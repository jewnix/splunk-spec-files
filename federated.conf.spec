#   Version 8.1.5
#
# This file contains possible setting and value pairs for federated provider entries
# for use in Data Fabric Search (DFS), when the federated search functionality is
# enabled.
#
# A federated search allows authorized users to run searches across multiple federated
# providers. Only Splunk deployments are supported as federated providers. Information
# on the Splunk deployment (i.e. the federated provider) is added in the federated
# provider stanza of the federated.conf file. A federated search deployment can have
# multiple federated search datasets. The settings for federated search dataset stanzas
# are located in savedsearches.conf.
#
# To learn more about configuration files (including precedence) please see the
# documentation located at
# http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Admin/Aboutconfigurationfiles
