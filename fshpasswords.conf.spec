# This file maintains the credential information associated with a federated provider.
#
# There is no global, default fshpasswords.conf. Instead, anytime a user creates
# a new user or edit a user assocated with a federated provider onwards hitting
# the fsh storage endpoint will create this fshpasswords.conf file.
#
# To learn more about configuration files (including precedence) please see the
# documentation located at
