# The full name of a string resource is stanza_name + '_' + attribute
# name.  After a descriptive attribute name, append two underscores,
# and then use the letters after the % in printf formatting strings,
# surrounded by underscores.  For example "MSG_NAME__D_LU_S" would
# expect 3 args, a %d, %lu, and %s.
