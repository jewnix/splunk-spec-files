[feature:search_v2_endpoint]

enable_search_v2_endpoint = <boolean>
* REMOVED. This setting no longer has any effect.
* Determines whether Splunk Web uses the v2 search endpoint.
* A value of "true" means Splunk Web uses the v2 search endpoint.
* Default: true

[feature:dashboards_csp]

enable_dashboards_external_content_restriction = <boolean>
* Whether or not Splunk Web restricts the loading of external content in Studio Dashboards or
  Classic Dashboards.
* A value of "true" means the following:
  * For Studio Dashboards, Splunk Web sets the Content-Security-Policy header, causing the
    browser to block images from external domains not included in the Dashboards Trusted
    Domains List (DTDL).
  * For Classic Dashboards, when the user loads a dashboard with external URLs not included
    in the DTDL, the user sees a warning modal. The user can decide to load the dashboard
    with external content or without external content.
* A value of "false" means the following:
  * For Studio Dashboards, Splunk Web does not set the Content-Security-Policy header. All
    external images load as usual and the browser does not block images.
  * For Classic Dashboards, all external content loads without warnings.
* Default: true

enable_dashboards_redirection_restriction = <boolean>
* Whether or not Splunk Web restricts redirecting to external content from Studio Dashboards or
  Classic Dashboards.
* A value of "true" means that the user sees a warning modal when redirecting to an external
  URL not included in the Dashboards Trusted Domains List. The user has the option to continue
  with the redirect or to cancel the redirect.
* A value of "false" means that nothing warns the user when redirecting to an external URL.
* Default: true

dashboards_trusted_domain.<name> = <string>
* A list of external domains that Splunk Web trusts for content loads and redirects. This list is
  called the Dashboards Trusted Domains List (DTDL).
* You must prefix each trusted domain on its own line with the string "dashboards_trusted_domain."
* The list has a maximum size of 6500 characters, after which any excess content will be ignored.
* If web-features.conf:'enable_dashboards_external_content_restriction' has a value of "true",
  then the following happens:
  * In Studio Dashboards, Splunk Web includes the DTDL in the Content-Security-Policy (CSP) page
    header.
    * The CSP header determines which domains Studio Dashboard can use to load images.
    * By default, 'self', data:, and blob: are added to the CSP header.
    * The browser prevents the loading of images from URLs not within the DTDL.
  * In Classic Dashboards, if the dashboard uses external URLs not included in the DTDL to load
    content, the user sees a warning modal.
* If web-features.conf:'enable_dashboards_external_content_restriction' has a value of "false" then
  the DTDL does not effect Dashboard loading and external content loads without warning.
* If web-features.conf:'enable_dashboards_redirection_restriction' has a value of "true", users
  see a warning modal when redirecting to an external URL not included in the DTDL.
* If web-features.conf:'enable_dashboards_redirection_restriction' has a value of "false" then the
  DTDL does not affect when a user redirects to an external URL, and no warning modal appears.
* Examples:
  * Only allow images from splunk.com and mozilla.org:
      dashboards_trusted_domain.endpoint1 = www.splunk.com
      dashboards_trusted_domain.endpoint2 = www.mozilla.org
  * Allow images from all external domains:
      dashboards_trusted_domain.endpoint1 = *
  * Only allow images starting with splunk.com/download/
      dashboards_trusted_domain.endpoint1 = www.splunk.com/download/
